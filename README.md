## Description
WeaponStats is a SourceMod plugin for Counter-Strike: Source that provides advanced cheat detection capabilities alongside detailed weapon statistics tracking. The plugin monitors player behavior to detect various forms of cheating including aimbots, triggerbots, silent aim, no-recoil cheats, and more, while simultaneously tracking comprehensive weapon usage statistics.

## How It Works
The plugin works by monitoring game events such as weapon fire, player hits, bullet impacts, and player deaths. It tracks each player's shooting patterns and analyzes them in real-time to identify suspicious behavior that may indicate cheating. All statistics are stored per-player and can be viewed using in-game commands.

### Detection Methods
1. **Aimbot Detection**: Monitors accuracy rates that exceed normal human capabilities
2. **Silent Aim Detection**: Analyzes angle differences between where a player is aiming and where they actually hit
3. **Aimlock Detection**: Identifies players who maintain perfect aim on targets for extended periods
4. **Recoil Control Detection**: Detects inhumanly perfect recoil control that exceeds normal human capabilities
5. **Triggerbot Detection**: Identifies inhumanly fast reaction times between seeing and shooting targets
6. **No-Scope Detection**: Detects high accuracy and headshot rates when using scoped weapons without scoping
7. **Statistical Anomaly Detection**: Flags when hit counts exceed shot counts
8. **Aim Snap Detection**: Identifies suspicious large angle changes that result in perfect hits
9. **Aim Velocity Monitoring**: Detects impossible aim turn speeds (degrees per second)
10. **Invalid Eye Angle Detection**: Catches aimbots that set impossible angles (pitch > 89Â° or roll â‰  0)
11. **SMAC/LILAC-Inspired Aim Consistency Checks**: Detects unnatural aim patterns with configurable thresholds
12. **Smoothness Analysis**: Identifies overly smooth aim movements characteristic of aimbots
13. **Perfect Aim Detection**: Flags consecutive perfect aim frames
14. **Trace Cheat Detection**: Catches shooting through walls and obstacles
15. **Enhanced Reaction Time Analysis**: Improved inhuman reaction detection with distance scaling

### Statistical Tracking
The plugin tracks detailed statistics including:
- Overall accuracy and headshot ratios
- Weapon-specific performance metrics
- Hit group distribution (which body parts are being hit)
- Kill statistics and headshot kill ratios
- Consecutive hit tracking
- Detailed suspicion analysis

## Cheat Detection Features
- **Multi-Cheat Detection**: Detects various forms of cheating including aimbots, triggerbots, and recoil cheats
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors all players for suspicious behavior
- **Configurable Thresholds**: All detection sensitivity levels can be adjusted via ConVars
- **Discord Integration**: Automatically sends detailed cheat reports to Discord webhooks
- **Admin Notifications**: Alerts admins in real-time when high suspicion levels are detected
- **Detailed Logging**: Maintains comprehensive logs of all detections and player statistics
- **Per-Player Tracking**: Maintains separate statistics for each player
- **Native Support**: Exposes detection statuses and suspicion levels to other plugins
- **Bot Compatibility**: Works with both human players and bots for comprehensive testing

## How to Detect a Cheater
The plugin automatically detects cheaters by analyzing various behavioral patterns:

1. **High Suspicion Levels**: When a player's suspicion level reaches 5/10 or higher, admins are notified
2. **Accuracy Anomalies**: Players with accuracy rates above configured thresholds (default 90-95%)
3. **Inhuman Reaction Times**: Players with reaction times faster than humanly possible
4. **Perfect Recoil Control**: Players who exhibit inhumanly perfect recoil control
5. **Aim Locking**: Players who maintain perfect aim on targets for extended periods
6. **Statistical Impossibilities**: When hit counts exceed shot counts
7. **Aim Snapping**: Players with suspicious large angle changes that result in perfect hits
8. **Invalid Eye Angles**: Players with impossible eye angles (pitch > 89Â° or roll â‰  0)
9. **Aim Consistency**: Players with unnatural aim patterns
10. **Smoothness**: Players with overly smooth aim movements
11. **Perfect Aim Frames**: Players with consecutive perfect aim frames
12. **Trace Cheats**: Players shooting through walls and obstacles

When suspicious behavior is detected, the plugin:
1. Logs the incident to detailed log files
2. Sends a notification to Discord (if configured)
3. Alerts in-game admins with detailed statistics
4. Provides suspicion analysis with specific cheat types detected

## Installation
1. Compile the .sp file and place the resulting .smx file in your `addons/sourcemod/plugins/` directory
2. Place the [weaponstats.phrases.txt](translations/weaponstats.phrases.txt) file in your `addons/sourcemod/translations/` directory
3. Restart the server or load the plugin
4. Configure the ConVars in `cfg/sourcemod/weaponstats.cfg` as needed
5. (Optional) Install the test plugin ([testws.smx](plugins/testws.smx)) to verify API functionality

## Notes
- The plugin is intended for use with Counter-Strike: Source and may not work with other games as it is not tested with them.
- It is recommended to use the latest version of SourceMod and the plugin to ensure compatibility and stability.
- Not every logic to detect cheaters is implemented and accurate.
- Before banning a player after he was detected as a cheater by this plugin, think about the consequences.
